# Cursor Rules for HoloPatcher.NET

## 1:1 Porting Requirements

When porting code from Python (vendor/PyKotor) to C#:

1. **Exact Code Matching**: All code must match the Python source 1:1, including:
   - Logic and control flow
   - Variable names (converted to C# naming conventions where necessary)
   - Comments (exact text, no additional comments)
   - Whitespace structure (where applicable)

2. **Comments**:
   - DO NOT add explanatory comments about how Python works
   - DO NOT add comments explaining the conversion
   - DO NOT add "1:1 port" comments
   - DO NOT add "TODO" comments unless they exist in Python
   - ONLY include comments that exist in the Python source
   - Match comment text exactly, including docstrings

3. **No Additional Code**:
   - DO NOT add helper methods unless they exist in Python
   - DO NOT add validation unless it exists in Python
   - DO NOT add error handling unless it exists in Python
   - DO NOT add optimizations unless they exist in Python

4. **Assumptions**:
   - If Python tests pass, the Python implementation is correct
   - If C# tests fail, the C# code does not match Python
   - Fix failures by matching Python exactly, not by "improving" the code

5. **File Structure**:
   - Match Python file organization where possible
   - Match class/method organization where possible

6. **Error Messages**:
   - Match Python error messages exactly (converted to C# string formatting)

## Testing

- All ported tests must pass
- Failing tests indicate the C# code does not match Python
- Fix by matching Python exactly, not by changing test expectations
