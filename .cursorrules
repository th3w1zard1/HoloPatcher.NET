# Cursor Rules for HoloPatcher.NET

## C# Language Version Requirements

**CRITICAL: The maximum C# language version allowed is 7.3. NEVER upgrade to C# 8.0 or higher.**

This is a hard requirement for .NET Framework 4.x compatibility. The following C# 8+ features are FORBIDDEN:

- Nullable reference types (`string?`, `object?`, etc.)
- Switch expressions
- Using declarations (must use `using` blocks)
- Default interface implementations
- Async streams
- Indices and ranges (`^1`, `..`)
- Null-coalescing assignment (`??=`)
- Pattern matching enhancements (property patterns, tuple patterns, positional patterns)
- Static local functions

When fixing code, convert C# 8+ syntax to C# 7.3 compatible alternatives, including but not limited to:

- `string?` → `string` (use `[CanBeNull]` attribute if needed and add `using JetBrains.Annotations;` if not already present)
- `value!` → `value` (remove null-forgiving operator)
- Switch expressions → switch statements
- `using var x = ...` → `using (var x = ...) { }`
- `namespace SomeNamespace;` → `namespace SomeNamespace { ... }`

## 1:1 Porting Requirements

When porting code from Python (vendor/PyKotor) to C#:

1. **Exact Code Matching**: All code must match the Python source 1:1, including:
   - Logic and control flow
   - Variable names (converted to C# naming conventions where necessary)
   - Comments (exact text, no additional comments)
   - Whitespace structure (where applicable)

2. **Comments**:
   - DO NOT add explanatory comments about how Python works
   - DO NOT add comments explaining the conversion
   - DO NOT add "1:1 port" comments
   - DO NOT add "TODO" comments unless they exist in Python
   - ONLY include comments that exist in the Python source
   - Match comment text exactly, including docstrings

3. **No Additional Code**:
   - DO NOT add helper methods unless they exist in Python
   - DO NOT add validation unless it exists in Python
   - DO NOT add error handling unless it exists in Python
   - DO NOT add optimizations unless they exist in Python

4. **Assumptions**:
   - If Python tests pass, the Python implementation is correct
   - If C# tests fail, the C# code does not match Python
   - Fix failures by matching Python exactly, not by "improving" the code

5. **File Structure**:
   - Match Python file organization where possible
   - Match class/method organization where possible

6. **Error Messages**:
   - Match Python error messages exactly (converted to C# string formatting)

## Testing

- All ported tests must pass
- Failing tests indicate the C# code does not match Python
- Fix by matching Python exactly, not by changing test expectations

## Matching Implementations

- All CSharpKOTOR code must be 1:1 matching the Python implementation in vendor/PyKotor.
- All DeNCS/NCSDecomp code (anything decompiling ncs->nss) must be 1:1 matching the Java implementation in vendor/DeNCS (may be alternatively in vendor/NCSDecomp). The PyKotor decompiler is nonfunctional, do NOT reference it for this specific scenario.

Ensure ANY AND ALL changes made to CSharpKOTOR properly specifies the relpath to the file in vendor that's being referenced to ensure 1:1 matches are maintained.

example: `Matching PyKotor implementation at Libraries/PyKotor/src/pykotor/extract/twoda.py:237` for line 237 in twoda.py in PyKotor. Use this pattern consistently.
